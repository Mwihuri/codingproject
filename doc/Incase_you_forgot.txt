Incase you forgot how to use Phynix Read the Doc module:

1) To work on the doc repository
   For a new dir use `` git clone https://github.com/edgehawk/docs.git ``
   Than run:

   $ git branch --list 
   $ git checkout <your working branch>
   $ git branch <new_branch_name if needed>

   https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging

   
   When finish, commit your changes and checkout back to master and marge the branch
   $ git checkout master
   $ git marge <new_branch>

2) For local changes and source control make sure that _templates/versions.html is deleted
   You can stash this change and discard it before push.

2) Edit the .rst files and at the end run:
   `` # cd ~/Tools/EH-Docs/docs``

   `make html`                            --> for no versions
   `sphinx-multiversion ./ _build/html`   --> for version control  

3) Good overview option, run a local web server:
   `` cd ~/Tools/EH-Docs/docs/_build/html ``
`` # python3 -m http.server ``
        Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://127.0.0.1:8000/) ...
